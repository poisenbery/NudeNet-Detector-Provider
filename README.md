Bethesda version of NudeNet V3 detector provider to work with Impact Pack ComfyUI.
Dilate does not work. It will give an error and I do not know how any of this works.

If you want dilate mask, use segs to mask -> dilate mask -> mask to segs

This is a very crude attempt and can 100% be made better by someone with actual programming experience.
