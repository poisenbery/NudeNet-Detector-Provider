BBOX Detector Provider for NudeNet

This is a hacked version that could be made better by someone with real programming experience.
I left the original code alone as much as possible.

Git Clone the repo into your Custom Nodes directory
The node will appear with the other Detector Providers under Impact Pack
Use it the same as any other BBOX detector provider.
