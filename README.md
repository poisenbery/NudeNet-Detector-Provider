SEGGSMaster is a pun on the SEGS data type and the colloquial misspelling of "Sex" as "seggs."

Bethesda version of NudeNet V3 detector provider to work with Impact Pack ComfyUI.
Dilate does not work. It will give an error and I do not know how any of this works.

If you want dilate mask, use segs to mask -> dilate mask -> mask to segs

This is a very crude attempt and can 100% be made better by someone with actual programming experience.
